###Challenge 3 of the FS Code Challenge problem set.

It is a vanilla JS and lodash + jQuery array manipulation exercise.

Challenge: Create an HTML page to display the data below.

It should use JS to update a tag with id="awesome-index" with the calculated average awesome-index of all programmers, and optionally dynamically load the data to show in the HTML. Add a little CSS, demonstrating properties of the "box model". Your solution should continue to work even if more people are added to the array. Write two versions, one using only vanilla JS, and one with lodash (or underscore) and jQuery, making maximal use of those libraries.
