## CodeFellows: Code Challenge

These are my answers to the Full-Stack DA problem set.

### Challenges:

  1. Create an HTML page to display the data below.

    * It should use JS to update a tag with id="awesome-index" with the calculated average awesome-index of all programmers, and optionally dynamically load the data to show in the HTML. Add a little CSS, demonstrating properties of the "box model". Your solution should continue to work even if more people are added to the array. Write two versions, one using only vanilla JS, and one with lodash (or underscore) and jQuery, making maximal use of those libraries.

  2. Create a simple HTTP server using node.

    * This server should respond to a root-url request with a file called index.html. Do not use Express.js. Your code should have error checking and at least one callback. Put five or more html elements in your index.html. One of the elements should be a link to an external page. Things to research: node.js, callbacks, the fs module, the http module.

  3. Model a library using objects.

    * A library contains shelves. Shelves contain books. Books have an author and a title. Give the library methods to add and remove a shelf. A shelf should have methods to add/remove a book. Use a modular approach so that each type of object is contained in its own file. Add any functionality you think appropriate.
